## Overview

The **BMI Calculator** app is a simple, user-friendly mobile application built using Flutter. It allows users to input their weight (in kilograms) and height (in feet and inches) to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI). The app then provides feedback on the user's weight status based on the calculated BMI, along with a color-coded background for quick reference.

## Features

- Input fields for weight (in kg) and height (in feet and inches).
- Real-time BMI calculation based on user input.
- Displays a message indicating the user's weight status: Underweight, Healthy, or Overweight.
- Dynamic background color change according to BMI status:
  - **Green** for healthy
  - **Orange** for overweight
  - **Red** for underweight
- Responsive design suitable for different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: The app is built entirely using Flutter, a popular open-source framework by Google for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
- **Dart**: The programming language used for Flutter development.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Flutter installed on your machine. You can download and install Flutter from the official Flutter website: [Flutter Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)

### Installation

To set up the BMI Calculator app locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shaharyar4t4/bmi-calculator.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd BMI-Calculator
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Run the app:**

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Usage

1. Launch the app on your Android or iOS device.
2. Enter your weight in kilograms in the first input field.
3. Enter your height in feet and inches in the respective input fields.
4. Tap the **Calculate** button.
5. The app will display your BMI and indicate whether you are underweight, healthy, or overweight.
6. Observe the background color change based on the BMI status.

## How It Works

The app calculates BMI using the following formula:

\[
\text{BMI} = \frac{\text{weight (kg)}}{\text{height (m)}^2}
\]

Where:
- Weight is provided in kilograms.
- Height is converted from feet and inches to meters.

The app takes the user's input for weight and height, performs the calculation, and updates the UI with the result. The background color of the app dynamically changes based on the BMI result to provide visual feedback:

- **Underweight**: Red background
- **Healthy**: Green background
- **Overweight**: Orange background
